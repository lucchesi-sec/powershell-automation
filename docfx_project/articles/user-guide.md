## Daily Operations

### Starting Your Day
Begin each workday with these essential checks:

1. **System Health Check**
   ```powershell
   # Import the core module
   Import-Module ./modules/PSAdminCore/PSAdminCore.psm1
   
   # Run daily health check
   ./scripts/maintenance/Monitor-CriticalServices.ps1 -SendEmail
   ```

2. **Review Overnight Backups**
   ```powershell
   # Check backup status
   ./scripts/backup/Test-BackupIntegrity.ps1 -ReportPath "C:\Reports"
   ```

3. **Security Compliance Check**
   ```powershell
   # Run security audit
   ./scripts/security/Test-SecurityCompliance.ps1 -GenerateReport
   ```

### Monitoring Dashboard
Access your monitoring dashboard to review:
- System performance metrics
- Active alerts and notifications
- Backup status and schedules
- Security compliance scores

## Common Tasks

### User Management

#### Adding New Users
```powershell
# Single user creation
./scripts/administration/New-ADUserWithStandardGroups.ps1 -FirstName "John" -LastName "Doe" -Department "IT"

# Bulk user creation from CSV
./scripts/administration/Import-ADUsersFromCSV.ps1 -CsvPath "C:\Data\NewUsers.csv"
```

#### User Lifecycle Management
```powershell
# Disable departing user
./scripts/administration/Disable-ADUser.ps1 -Username "john.doe" -BackupData

# Transfer user data
./scripts/administration/Transfer-UserData.ps1 -FromUser "john.doe" -ToUser "jane.smith"
```

### System Maintenance

#### Disk Space Management
```powershell
# Clean up disk space
./scripts/maintenance/Clear-DiskSpace.ps1 -WhatIf

# After reviewing, execute the cleanup
./scripts/maintenance/Clear-DiskSpace.ps1 -Confirm:$false
```

#### Service Monitoring
```powershell
# Monitor critical services
./scripts/maintenance/Monitor-CriticalServices.ps1 -Services "WinRM", "DNS", "DHCP"
```

### Backup Operations

#### Manual Backup
```powershell
# Perform immediate backup
./scripts/backup/Start-BackupJob.ps1 -BackupType "Full" -Priority "High"
```

#### Backup Verification
```powershell
# Test backup integrity
./scripts/backup/Test-BackupIntegrity.ps1 -BackupPath "\\BackupServer\Backups"
```

### Security Operations

#### Security Auditing
```powershell
# Run comprehensive security audit
./scripts/security/Invoke-SecurityAudit.ps1 -FullScan -EmailReport
```

#### Compliance Reporting
```powershell
# Generate compliance report
./scripts/security/New-ComplianceReport.ps1 -Standard "CIS" -OutputFormat "HTML"
```

## Advanced Features

### Automation Scheduling

#### Using Windows Task Scheduler
```powershell
# Create scheduled task for daily maintenance
$Action = New-ScheduledTaskAction -Execute "PowerShell.exe" -Argument "-File C:\Scripts\DailyMaintenance.ps1"
$Trigger = New-ScheduledTaskTrigger -Daily -At 2:00AM
$Settings = New-ScheduledTaskSettingsSet -RunOnlyIfNetworkAvailable
Register-ScheduledTask -TaskName "Daily Maintenance" -Action $Action -Trigger $Trigger -Settings $Settings
```

#### Automated Reporting
Configure automated reports to be sent to stakeholders:
```powershell
# Setup weekly summary report
./scripts/reports/New-WeeklySummaryReport.ps1 -Recipients "it-team@company.com" -Schedule "Weekly"
```

### Cloud Integration

#### Azure Integration
```powershell
# Sync backups to Azure
./scripts/cloud/Sync-BackupToAzure.ps1 -StorageAccount "companybackups" -Container "daily-backups"
```

#### Multi-Cloud Backup
```powershell
# Backup to multiple cloud providers
./scripts/backup/Start-MultiCloudBackup.ps1 -Providers "Azure", "AWS", "GCP"
```

### Custom Automation

#### Creating Custom Scripts
1. **Use the Template**
   ```powershell
   # Copy script template
   Copy-Item "./templates/ScriptTemplate.ps1" "./scripts/custom/MyCustomScript.ps1"
   ```

2. **Follow Best Practices**
   - Include proper error handling
   - Add comprehensive logging
   - Use parameter validation
   - Include help documentation

3. **Test Thoroughly**
   ```powershell
   # Test your custom script
   ./scripts/custom/MyCustomScript.ps1 -WhatIf -Verbose
   ```

## Best Practices

### Security
- **Never hardcode credentials** - Use Windows Credential Manager
- **Validate all inputs** - Implement proper parameter validation
- **Use least privilege** - Run with minimum required permissions
- **Audit all operations** - Enable comprehensive logging

### Performance
- **Monitor resource usage** - Track CPU, memory, and disk usage
- **Optimize large datasets** - Use streaming for large file operations
- **Schedule intensive tasks** - Run during off-peak hours
- **Use parallel processing** - Leverage PowerShell jobs for concurrent operations

### Reliability
- **Implement error handling** - Use try-catch blocks appropriately
- **Validate prerequisites** - Check dependencies before execution
- **Test in development** - Use -WhatIf parameter for testing
- **Monitor execution** - Use logging to track script behavior

### Maintenance
- **Regular updates** - Keep modules and scripts current
- **Review logs** - Analyze execution logs regularly
- **Clean up old data** - Implement retention policies
- **Document changes** - Maintain change logs

## Configuration Management

### Environment Configuration
```powershell
# Set environment-specific settings
$Config = @{
    Environment = "Production"
    LogLevel = "Information"
    EmailEnabled = $true
    BackupRetention = 30
}
$Config | ConvertTo-Json | Out-File "./config/environment.json"
```

### Module Configuration
```powershell
# Configure module settings
Set-PSAdminConfiguration -LogPath "C:\Logs\PSAdmin" -EmailServer "smtp.company.com"
```

## Reporting and Analytics

### Generating Reports
```powershell
# Generate monthly operations report
./scripts/reports/New-MonthlyOperationsReport.ps1 -Month (Get-Date).Month -Year (Get-Date).Year
```

### Performance Analytics
```powershell
# Analyze system performance trends
./scripts/analytics/Get-PerformanceTrends.ps1 -Period "30days" -Metrics "CPU", "Memory", "Disk"
```

## Integration with Other Systems

### SIEM Integration
```powershell
# Send events to SIEM
./scripts/security/Send-EventToSIEM.ps1 -Event $SecurityEvent -Priority "High"
```

### Ticketing System Integration
```powershell
# Create automated tickets
./scripts/integration/New-ServiceTicket.ps1 -Title "Automated Alert" -Description $AlertDetails
```

## Troubleshooting

For detailed troubleshooting information, see the [Troubleshooting Guide](TROUBLESHOOTING.md).

### Common Issues
- **Module Import Errors**: Check PowerShell execution policy
- **Permission Denied**: Verify administrative privileges
- **Network Connectivity**: Test network connections and firewall rules
- **Authentication Failures**: Verify credentials and domain connectivity

### Getting Help
```powershell
# Get help for any script
Get-Help ./scripts/maintenance/Monitor-CriticalServices.ps1 -Full

# Get help for module functions
Get-Help Test-AdminPrivileges -Examples
```
