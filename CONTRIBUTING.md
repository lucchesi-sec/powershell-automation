## Code of Conduct
In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we expect all contributors to be respectful and considerate of others. By participating in this project, you agree to:
- Be respectful of different viewpoints and experiences.
- Gracefully accept constructive criticism.
- Focus on what is best for the community.
- Show empathy towards other community members.

## How Can I Contribute?
There are many ways to contribute to the PowerShell Automation Platform:
- **Reporting Bugs**: Submit bug reports with detailed descriptions and reproduction steps.
- **Suggesting Enhancements**: Propose new features or improvements to existing functionality.
- **Code Contributions**: Develop new modules, scripts, or fix issues in the codebase.
- **Documentation**: Improve project documentation, including READMEs, guides, and inline comments.
- **Testing**: Write or improve tests to ensure the reliability of the platform.

## Development Workflow
1. **Fork the Repository**: Create your own fork of the codebase.
2. **Clone the Repository**: Clone your fork to your local machine.
3. **Create a Branch**: Create a feature or bugfix branch with a descriptive name (e.g., `feature/add-user-sync` or `bugfix/fix-backup-error`).
4. **Make Changes**: Implement your changes, adhering to the coding standards and documentation guidelines.
5. **Commit Changes**: Commit your changes with meaningful commit messages following the [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format if possible.
6. **Push Changes**: Push your branch to your fork on GitHub.
7. **Submit a Pull Request**: Create a pull request from your branch to the main repository's `main` branch.

## Coding Standards
We aim to maintain a high-quality, consistent codebase:
- **PowerShell Style Guide**: Follow the [PowerShell Practice and Style Guide](https://poshcode.gitbooks.io/powershell-practice-and-style/) for naming conventions, formatting, and best practices.
- **Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error handling using `try`/`catch` blocks where appropriate.
- **Logging**: Use the logging functions from `PSAdminCore` for consistent logging across scripts and modules.
- **Modularity**: Write reusable code by creating functions or modules that can be used across different scripts.
- **Commenting**: Include comment-based help for all functions and scripts, following PowerShell's comment-based help format.

## Documentation Guidelines
Documentation is critical for the usability and maintainability of the platform:
- **Inline Documentation**: Document functions and scripts with comment-based help that includes synopsis, description, parameters, examples, and notes.
- **Project Documentation**: Update relevant documentation in the `docs` directory for architectural changes or new features.
- **README Updates**: Ensure the main `README.md` reflects any new functionality or changes in usage.
- **Docs-as-Code**: Treat documentation as part of the codebase, ensuring it is version-controlled and updated with code changes.

## Testing Requirements
All code contributions must include appropriate tests:
- **Unit Tests**: Write unit tests for individual functions and modules, placed in the `tests/unit` directory.
- **Integration Tests**: For larger features or scripts, include integration tests in the `tests/integration` directory.
- **Pester Framework**: Use the Pester testing framework for writing and running tests.
- **Test Coverage**: Aim for high test coverage, especially for critical functionality like security and backup operations.
- **Test Execution**: Ensure tests pass locally before submitting a pull request. Run tests with `Invoke-Pester` in the appropriate test directory.

## Pull Request Process
1. **Fill in the Template**: Complete the pull request template with details about your changes, including motivation, approach, and testing performed.
2. **Reference Issues**: Link to any related issues or feature requests in your pull request description.
3. **Ensure CI/CD Passes**: Verify that automated checks and tests pass on your pull request.
4. **Address Feedback**: Respond to reviewer comments and make necessary changes to your code or documentation.

## Review Process
Pull requests will be reviewed by maintainers based on:
- **Code Quality**: Adherence to coding standards and best practices.
- **Functionality**: Whether the change meets the intended purpose and integrates well with existing code.
- **Testing**: Presence and quality of tests to validate the change.
- **Documentation**: Completeness and accuracy of documentation updates.
- **Impact**: Consideration of the change's impact on performance, security, and compatibility.

Reviewers may request changes before merging. Once approved, your contribution will be merged into the main branch.
