# PowerShell CI/CD Pipeline Validation Checklist

This document serves as a comprehensive checklist for validating the PowerShell CI/CD pipeline implementation. Use this checklist during initial setup, after major changes, and for periodic health checks.

## Pre-Implementation Validation

### Infrastructure Setup
- [ ] GitHub repository is properly configured

### PowerShell Environment
- [ ] PowerShell 7+ can be installed on Ubuntu runners
- [ ] PowerShell Gallery is accessible from GitHub Actions
- [ ] No proxy configuration blocking module downloads
- [ ] Runner has sufficient permissions for module installation

### Pipeline Scripts
- [ ] `scripts/pipeline/Install-PSScriptAnalyzer.ps1` exists and is executable
- [ ] `scripts/pipeline/Invoke-CodeAnalysis.ps1` exists and is executable
- [ ] `scripts/pipeline/Format-AnalysisReport.ps1` exists and is executable
- [ ] All pipeline scripts have proper error handling
- [ ] Scripts use GitHub Actions compatible output format

## Functional Validation

### Workflow Configuration
- [ ] Main workflow file exists: `.github/workflows/powershell-ci.yml`
- [ ] Workflow syntax is valid YAML
- [ ] Workflow triggers on push to main/master branch
- [ ] Workflow can be manually triggered (workflow_dispatch)
- [ ] Workflow timeout is configured (10 minutes default)
- [ ] Job names are descriptive and clear

### PSScriptAnalyzer Integration
- [ ] PSScriptAnalyzer installs successfully
- [ ] Latest version is installed by default
- [ ] Specific version can be installed if required
- [ ] Installation handles network failures gracefully
- [ ] Module imports without errors
- [ ] Default ruleset is loaded correctly
- [ ] All rules are available and functional

### Code Analysis Execution
- [ ] Analysis finds all `.psm1` files recursively
- [ ] Analysis excludes test directories appropriately
- [ ] Empty directories are handled gracefully
- [ ] Missing module files generate appropriate warnings
- [ ] Syntax errors are detected and reported
- [ ] Rule violations are properly categorized by severity
- [ ] Analysis completes within performance targets

### Reporting and Output
- [ ] GitHub Actions annotations appear inline in PR files
- [ ] Console output is clear and readable
- [ ] Error messages include file path, line, and column
- [ ] Summary statistics are accurate
- [ ] HTML/Markdown/JSON reports can be generated
- [ ] Artifacts are uploaded for failed runs
- [ ] GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY is populated correctly

## Performance Validation

### Execution Time
- [ ] Pipeline completes within 5-minute target for typical repository
- [ ] PSScriptAnalyzer installation is cached when possible
- [ ] Analysis scales linearly with number of modules
- [ ] No unnecessary delays or timeouts
- [ ] Parallel execution works when configured

### Resource Usage
- [ ] Memory usage remains reasonable
- [ ] No disk space issues during execution
- [ ] Network bandwidth is used efficiently
- [ ] CPU usage is appropriate for workload

## Notification System Validation

### GitHub Notifications
- [ ] Commit author receives notification on failure
- [ ] Notification includes direct link to failed workflow
- [ ] Only commit author is notified (not entire team)
- [ ] Notifications arrive promptly
- [ ] Email notifications work (if configured in GitHub)
- [ ] Mobile app notifications work (if configured)

### Status Updates
- [ ] Commit status is updated to "pending" when pipeline starts
- [ ] Commit status shows "success" when pipeline passes
- [ ] Commit status shows "failure" with details when pipeline fails
- [ ] Status checks appear in pull requests
- [ ] Branch protection rules respect pipeline status

## Error Handling Validation

### Missing Dependencies
- [ ] Clear error when PSScriptAnalyzer not found
- [ ] Helpful message about installation steps
- [ ] Non-zero exit code returned
- [ ] Pipeline fails gracefully

### Network Issues
- [ ] Timeout errors are caught and reported
- [ ] Retry logic works for transient failures
- [ ] Offline scenarios produce clear errors
- [ ] Alternative module sources can be configured

### Code Issues
- [ ] Syntax errors in modules are detected
- [ ] Malformed module files are handled
- [ ] Very large files don't cause timeouts
- [ ] Unicode/encoding issues are handled

### Permission Issues
- [ ] Insufficient permissions produce clear errors
- [ ] Read-only file systems are detected
- [ ] Module installation falls back to user scope
- [ ] No silent failures due to permissions

## Integration Testing

### Pull Request Integration
- [ ] Pipeline runs on pull request events (if configured)
- [ ] Annotations appear in PR diff view
- [ ] Status checks block merging (if configured)
- [ ] Comments can be posted to PRs
- [ ] Review feedback is actionable

### Badge Integration
- [ ] README badge shows current pipeline status
- [ ] Badge URL is correct and accessible
- [ ] Badge updates after each pipeline run
- [ ] Badge styling matches repository theme

### Artifact Management
- [ ] Analysis reports are uploaded as artifacts
- [ ] Artifacts are retained for configured period
- [ ] Artifact download works correctly
- [ ] Sensitive data is not exposed in artifacts

## Security Validation

### Permissions
- [ ] Workflow uses minimal required permissions
- [ ] No hardcoded credentials or secrets
- [ ] GITHUB_TOKEN scope is appropriate
- [ ] Third-party actions are from trusted sources
- [ ] No arbitrary code execution vulnerabilities

### Data Protection
- [ ] No sensitive data in logs
- [ ] File paths are sanitized in output
- [ ] Error messages don't expose system details
- [ ] Artifacts don't contain sensitive information

## Edge Case Testing

### Empty Repository
- [ ] Pipeline handles no module files gracefully
- [ ] Appropriate warning message is shown
- [ ] Pipeline exits with success (warning only)
- [ ] No null reference exceptions

### Large Repository
- [ ] Pipeline handles 50+ modules efficiently
- [ ] No timeout issues with large codebases
- [ ] Memory usage remains stable
- [ ] Output remains readable

### Concurrent Executions
- [ ] Multiple pipeline runs don't conflict
- [ ] Resource contention is handled
- [ ] Cache corruption is prevented
- [ ] Results remain accurate

### Special Characters
- [ ] Files with spaces in names work correctly
- [ ] Unicode characters in paths are handled
- [ ] Special characters in code don't break analysis
- [ ] Different line endings (CRLF/LF) work

## Post-Implementation Validation

### Documentation
- [ ] Pipeline guide is accurate and complete
- [ ] README includes setup instructions
- [ ] Troubleshooting guide covers common issues
- [ ] Examples are working and up-to-date
- [ ] Configuration options are documented

### Team Readiness
- [ ] Team members understand pipeline purpose
- [ ] Developers know how to read pipeline output
- [ ] Common fixes for violations are documented
- [ ] Escalation path for pipeline issues is clear
- [ ] Training materials are available

### Monitoring and Metrics
- [ ] Pipeline success rate is tracked
- [ ] Average execution time is monitored
- [ ] Common failure reasons are identified
- [ ] Improvement opportunities are documented
- [ ] Success metrics align with PRD goals

### Maintenance Plan
- [ ] Regular updates for PSScriptAnalyzer planned
- [ ] GitHub Actions runner updates monitored
- [ ] PowerShell version updates considered
- [ ] Custom rules can be added as needed
- [ ] Performance optimization plan exists
