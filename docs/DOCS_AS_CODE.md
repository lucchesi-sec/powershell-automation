## Introduction
The PowerShell Automation Platform adopts a docs-as-code framework to ensure that documentation is treated as an integral part of the software development process. This approach aligns documentation with code, enabling continuous integration, version control, and collaborative maintenance.

## What is Docs-as-Code?
Docs-as-Code is a philosophy and practice where documentation is managed in the same way as source code:
- Stored in version control systems alongside the codebase.
- Written in plain text formats like Markdown for easy editing and diffing.
- Subject to the same review, testing, and deployment processes as code.
- Updated continuously as part of the development workflow.

## Benefits of Docs-as-Code
- **Consistency**: Documentation stays in sync with code changes, reducing discrepancies.
- **Collaboration**: Developers and documentation contributors work in the same environment, using familiar tools.
- **Versioning**: Documentation versions match code versions, ensuring historical accuracy.
- **Automation**: Documentation updates can be automated through CI/CD pipelines.
- **Quality**: Peer reviews and automated checks improve documentation quality.

## Implementation Strategy
### Version Control
- All documentation is stored in the project's Git repository under the `docs` directory.
- Documentation changes are committed with descriptive messages, linked to related code changes or issues.
- Branching strategies (e.g., feature branches) apply to documentation, ensuring changes are tested before merging.

### Documentation Structure
- **Centralized Location**: Core documentation files like `README.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, and `CONTRIBUTING.md` are at the root or in the `docs` directory.
- **Module Documentation**: Each module in `modules` should include a README or inline comment-based help for functions.
- **Script Documentation**: Scripts in `scripts/administration` must have comment-based help and usage examples.
- **Format**: Use Markdown for project-level documentation and PowerShell comment-based help for code-level documentation.

### Workflow Integration
- **Pull Requests**: Documentation updates are submitted via pull requests, reviewed alongside code changes.
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Integrate documentation validation into CI/CD pipelines to check for formatting, broken links, and completeness.
- **Release Process**: Documentation for new features or changes must be updated before a release is tagged.

### Automation Tools
- **Linting**: Use tools like `markdownlint` to enforce consistent formatting in Markdown files.
- **Link Checking**: Automate checks for broken links in documentation using tools integrated into CI pipelines.
- **Documentation Generation**: Explore tools like `PSDoc` for generating documentation from comment-based help in PowerShell scripts.
- **Deployment**: Automatically deploy documentation to a static site or internal wiki as part of the release process (future goal).

### Review and Approval Process
- Documentation changes are subject to the same peer review process as code, ensuring accuracy and clarity.
- Assign documentation reviewers to validate content against project standards and user needs.
- Use checklists in pull requests to confirm that documentation meets requirements (e.g., includes examples, parameters, etc.).

## Roles and Responsibilities
- **Documentation Lead**: A designated team member oversees the docs-as-code strategy, ensuring adherence to guidelines and prioritizing documentation tasks.
- **Developers**: Responsible for updating inline documentation and module READMEs when adding or modifying code.
- **Contributors**: Must include documentation updates with code contributions, following the guidelines in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
- **Reviewers**: Validate documentation as part of the pull request review, ensuring it is complete and user-friendly.

## Maintenance and Updates
- **Regular Audits**: Conduct periodic reviews of documentation to identify outdated or missing content.
- **Issue Tracking**: Use GitHub Issues to track documentation tasks, bugs, or improvement suggestions.
- **Feedback Loop**: Encourage users and developers to provide feedback on documentation usability, integrating suggestions into updates.
- **Version Alignment**: Ensure documentation reflects the current version of the codebase, with historical versions archived if necessary.

## Tools and Resources
- **GitHub**: For version control, pull requests, and issue tracking.
- **Markdown Editors**: Tools like VS Code with Markdown extensions for writing and previewing documentation.
- **PowerShell Help**: Leverage PowerShell's built-in help system for generating user assistance from comment-based help.
- **CI/CD Tools**: GitHub Actions or similar for automating documentation checks and deployment.
- **Community Resources**: Reference PowerShell community best practices and style guides for documentation standards.

By implementing this docs-as-code framework, the PowerShell Automation Platform ensures that documentation remains a living, integral part of the project, evolving alongside the code to support users and contributors effectively.
